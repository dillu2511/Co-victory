<h2><b>Diagnosis<b></h2>
<p>If you develop symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or you've been exposed to the COVID-19 virus, contact your health care team. Also let your health care team know if you've had close contact with anyone who has been diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Factors used to decide whether to test you for the virus that causes COVID-19 may differ depending on where you live. Depending on your location, you may need to be screened by your clinic to determine if testing is appropriate and available.</p>
<p>In the U.S., your health care team will determine whether to conduct tests for the virus that causes COVID-19 based on your symptoms, as well as whether you have had close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>You also may be tested if you are at higher risk of serious illness or you are going to have a medical procedure.</p>
<p>If you have had close contact with someone with COVID-19 but you've had COVID-19 in the past month, you don't need to be tested.</p>
<p>If you've been fully vaccinated and you've had close contact with someone with COVID-19, get tested five days after you've had contact with that person.</p>
<p>If you've been fully vaccinated and you've had close contact with someone with COVID-19, get tested five days after you've had contact with that person.</p>
<p>To test for the COVID-19 virus, a health care professional takes a sample from the nose (nasopharyngeal swab), throat (throat swab) or saliva. The samples are then sent to a lab for testing. If you're coughing up sputum, that may be sent for testing.</p>
<p>At-home tests for COVID-19 are available at many pharmacies. Some of these tests require a prescription, but some, called antigen tests, are available without a prescription. Antigen tests are not as reliable as the test done in a lab. But it is a fast and easy way to test yourself as soon as you have symptoms or at least five days after you've been exposed to the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>If you test negative, you can take the test a second time a few days later to help ensure your test results are accurate. The accuracy of each of these tests varies. So a negative test does not completely rule out having the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>Only get an at-home test that's authorized by the FDA or approved by your health care professional or local health department.</p>

<h2><b>Treatment<b></h2><br>

 <p>Currently, a few medicines have been approved to treat COVID-19. No cure is available for COVID-19. Antibiotics aren't effective against viral infections such as COVID-19. Researchers are testing a variety of possible treatments.</p>

 <p>The FDA has approved the antiviral medicine remdesivir (Veklury) to treat COVID-19 in adults and children who are age 12 and older in the hospital. Remdesivir may be prescribed for people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 and need supplemental oxygen or have a higher risk of serious illness. It's given through a needle in the vein.</p>

 <p>Paxlovid is another medicine approved to treat COVID-19 in adults. It includes nirmatrelvir — a drug that blocks the activity of a specific enzyme needed for the virus that causes COVID-19 to replicate — and an antiviral drug called ritonavir that helps slow the breakdown of nirmatrelvir. Paxlovid continues to be available under emergency use authorization to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 in people age 12 and older who are at higher risk of serious illness. Paxlovid pills are taken by mouth.</p>

 <p>The FDA also has approved the rheumatoid arthritis drugs baricitinib (Olumiant) and tocilizumab (Actemra) to treat COVID-19 in some cases. Baricitinib is a pill that seems to work against COVID-19 by reducing inflammation and having antiviral activity. Tocilizumab is an injection. It seems to work against COVID-19 by reducing inflammation. Both medicines may be used in people in the hospital with COVID-19 who are on mechanical ventilators or need supplemental oxygen.</p>

 <p>The U.S. National Institutes of Health has recommended the corticosteroid dexamethasone for people hospitalized with severe COVID-19 who are on supplemental oxygen or need mechanical ventilation. Other corticosteroids, such as prednisone, methylprednisolone (Medrol) or hydrocortisone, may be used if dexamethasone isn't available.</p>

<p>In some cases, the drugs remdesivir, tocilizumab or baricitinib may be given with dexamethasone in people who are on mechanical ventilation or need supplemental oxygen in the hospital.</p>

<p>Other therapies also may be used for people who need oxygen or who are on mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, called ECMO. The immune system suppression drug anakinra (Kineret) was authorized by the FDA for people who need supplemental oxygen. And vilobelimab (Gohibic), a monoclonal antibody, was authorized by the FDA for those who are on mechanical ventilation or ECMO.</p>
<p>The FDA also has authorized COVID-19 convalescent plasma therapy with high antibody levels to treat COVID-19. Convalescent plasma is blood donated by people who've recovered from COVID-19. Convalescent plasma with high antibodies may be used to help people diagnosed with COVID-19 who have weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Many people with COVID-19 may have mild illness and can be treated with supportive care. Supportive care is aimed at relieving symptoms and may include:</p>

<div class="unorderlist-1">
          <div class="row-3">
          <div class="col-md-12">          
      <ul>
         <li>Pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.</li><br>
         <li>Cough syrup or medicine.</li><br>
         <li>Rest.</li><br>
         <li>Fluid intake.</li><br>
      </ul>

      <p>There is no evidence that ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) need to be avoided.</p>
      <p>If you have mild symptoms, your health care professional will likely recommend that you recover at home. </p>
      <p>You may be given special instructions to monitor your symptoms and to avoid spreading the illness to others. You'll likely be asked to isolate yourself as much as possible from family and pets while you're sick, wear a mask when you're around people and pets, and use a separate bedroom and bathroom.</p>
      <p>And keep airflow in your home by opening windows and using air filters when possible.</p>
      <p>Your health care team will likely recommend that you stay in home isolation for a period of time except to get medical care. Your health care professional will likely follow up with you regularly.</p>
      <p>Follow guidelines from your health care team and local health department about when you can end home isolation.</p>
      <p>If you're very ill, you may need to be treated in the hospital.</p><br>

       <h2><b>Coping and support<b></h2><br>

<p>It's common to feel fearful and anxious during the COVID-19 pandemic. You may be worried that you or those you love will get sick. You may be concerned about taking care of yourself or others who are ill.</p>

<p>During this time, remember to take care of yourself and manage your stress.</p>

<ul>
         <li>Eat healthy meals.</li><br>
         <li>Get enough sleep.</li><br>
         <li>Get physical activity.</li><br>
         <li>Try relaxation exercises such as deep breathing, stretching and meditation.</li><br>
         <li>Avoid watching or reading too much news.</li><br>
         <li>Connect with friends and family, such as with phone or video calls.</li><br>
         <li>Do activities you enjoy, such as reading a book or watching a funny movie.</li><br>
</ul>

<p>If you're ill with COVID-19, it's especially important to:</p>

<ul>
         <li>Get plenty of rest.</li><br>
         <li>Drink fluids.</li><br>
         <li>Let your health care professional know right away if your symptoms worsen.</li><br>
</ul>

<p>Having COVID-19 or caring for someone with the disease can cause stress and anxiety. If stress is affecting your daily life after several days, contact your health care professional and consider requesting a referral to a mental health professional.</p>

 <h2><b>Preparing for your appointment<b></h2>

  <p>To be treated for COVID-19, you may start by seeing your primary care doctor or other health care professional. Or you may be referred immediately to a specialist trained in treating infectious diseases. If you think you have COVID-19, tell your health care professional before going in for an appointment. Your health care team can then:</p>

  <ul>
         <li>Contact infection prevention and control and public health officials.</li><br>
         <li>Prepare to move you to a room quickly.</li><br>
         <li>Have a mask ready for you.</li><br>
  </ul>

<p>Here's some information to help you get ready for your appointment.</p>

<h4><b>What you can do<b></h4>

 <p>When you make the appointment, ask if there's anything you need to do in advance. Make a list of:</p>

 <ul>
         <li><b>Your symptoms,<b> including any that seem unrelated to the reason for your appointment.</li><br>
         <li><b>Your recent travels,<b> including any international travels.</li><br>
         <li><b>Key personal information,<b> including major stresses, recent life changes and family medical history.</li><br>
         <li><b>All medications,<b> vitamins or other supplements you take, including the doses.</li><br>
         <li><b>Questions to ask<b> your doctor.</li><br>
  </ul>

<p>Take a family member or friend along, if possible, to help you remember the information you're given. Avoid bringing more than one or two people. Check before you go to the appointment, as your hospital or clinic may have visitor restrictions.</p>

<p>Some basic questions to ask your health care team include:</p>

<ul>
         <li>How likely is it that COVID-19 is causing my symptoms? </li><br>
         <li>What are other possible causes for my symptoms?</li><br>
         <li>What tests do I need?</li><br>
         <li>What course of action do you recommend?</li><br>
         <li>Are there restrictions I need to follow?</li><br>
         <li>Should I see a specialist?</li><br>
  </ul>

<h3><b>What to expect from your doctor<b></h3>

 <p>Your health care professional is likely to ask you several questions, such as:</p>

<ul>
         <li>When did your symptoms begin?</li><br>
         <li>Where have you traveled recently?</li><br>
         <li>Who have you been in close contact with?</li><br>
         <li>How severe are your symptoms?</li><br>
